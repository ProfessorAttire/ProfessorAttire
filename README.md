ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ProfessorAttire, but you can call me Patrick!
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™ve recently started learning Full Stack Web Development with Devslopes and have developed an interest in video game development and web extensions.
ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m learning the basics. Iâ€™ve been stuck in tutorial hell for a while, but Iâ€™m determined to make my way out!
